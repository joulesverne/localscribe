STEVE: March 11th and Episode 1016.  And I was a little jealous of hearing you talk about the 20th anniversary...

LEO:  Yeah.

STEVE:  ...upcoming for TWiT.	

LEO:  April 13th will be our 20th year of TWiTs.

STEVE:  Yup.  And so you did that for a few months before you said, "Hey, Gibson."

LEO:  Yeah, your 20th's coming up.

STEVE:  "I think we're ready to add a second podcast to our network."  Actually, I guess that would create a network; right?  It really wouldn't be a network with one podcast.

LEO:  Yeah.  Until then it was just a podcast, yeah.  Yeah, that's right.  So your 20th should be in the fall, I guess, yeah?  Soon.

STEVE:  Yeah, it is.

LEO:  Well, we could do something special for that.  Think about what you want to do.

STEVE:  Let's just ignore it.  No.  We're going to let my birthday go by.  We're going to let the 20th podcast, 20th anniversary podcast...

LEO:  I'm the same, exactly.  But I did, you know, on the thousandth episode we had all of the original hosts from Episode 1 back.
